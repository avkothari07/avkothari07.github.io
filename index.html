<h1>Mach5 Interceptor</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	Mach5 is database platform start up that will have the same capabilities and functionalities as Elasticsearch with additional features. The Interceptor project's goal was to create a Rust program that proves that the new Mach5 database and Elasticsearch have the same functionality. As a part of the project, I built reverse proxies with Nginx and Rust to log requests and responses between Kibana and Elasticsearch. I also designed and wrote a program to send and replay HTTP requests to Elasticsearch and new Mach5 database to illustrate shared functionality in Rust.
