<h1>Mach5 Interceptor</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	Mach5 is database platform start-up that will have the same capabilities and functionalities as Elasticsearch with additional features. The Interceptor project's goal was to create a Rust program that proves that the new Mach5 database and Elasticsearch have the same functionality. As a part of the project, I built reverse proxies with Nginx and Rust to log requests and responses between Kibana and Elasticsearch. I also designed and wrote a program to send and replay HTTP requests to Elasticsearch and new Mach5 database to illustrate shared functionality in Rust. 
</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>
    Because the Interceptor is a key piece of Mach5's new technology, I cannot share source code for this project; however, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments about the project.

<h1>StudyPay Application</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	StudyPay is an app utilized by the Nock Lab at Harvard University to track and compensate research participants for completing forms and other tasks for research projects. In the summer of 2019, I redesigned this application with the lab's lead software engineer. In our redesign of the application, we created template screens and elements on AdobeXD and prioritized UX. 
</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>
    The application can be found on the Apple App Store <a href = "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/studypay/id1460432799">here</a>. 
</p>
<h2>Note</h2>

<p>
    Only users with login credentials provided by a research team can access the full functionalities of the application. 
</p>

<h1>Course Projects</h1>

<hr>

<p>
	To prevent plagiarism, the source code for my course projects cannot be uploaded publicly to GitHub. For each course, I have listed a few of most noteworthy projects I completed.
</p>

<h2>CS 11: Introduction to Computer Science (C++)</h2>
<ol>
  <li> <u>Splendor</u>: Implemented the multiplayer board game Splendor for users to play in command line with vectors, queues, and several classes. </li>
  <li> <u>Advising Period</u>: Wrote a recursive program that allows a user to modify faculty's advisees and supervisees and track which member's of faculty may have bandwidth to accept new advisees and supervisees with binary search trees. </li>
</ol>
<h2>CS 15: Data Structures (C++)</h2>
<ol>
</ol>
<h2>CS 40: Machine Structure and Assembly Level Programming (C)</h2>
<ol>
  <li> <u>Universal Machine</u>: Implemented an emulator for a machine described by course staff by prioritizing abstraction in interfaces created with sequences and arrays to represent memory and registers and to pack and unpack bitpacked values. As a follow up to the assignment, we identified bottlenecks through kchachegrind and assembly level code to optimize performance of the program as much as possible.</li>
  <li> <u>PPMDiff</u>: Wrote a program that compresses and decompresses images by use of Discrete Cosine Transformation, Component Video Conversions, Quanitization of Chroma, and bitpacked values. Minimized root mean square difference between images before they had been compressed and images after they had been compressed and decompressed.</li>
  <li> <u>Unblackedges</u>: Created 2-dimensional UArray and Bit interfaces to recursively remove black shadowing from the edges of a PDF file.</li>
</ol>
